# scGHSOM Web Server

**scGHSOM-Web-Server** is an ongoing project aimed at transforming the original [scGHSOM single-cell clustering algorithm](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098883) into a fully functional **web-based analysis platform**.

This work is being prepared for submission to the **Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) — Web Server Issue** in late December, with the goal of making hierarchical SOM–based single-cell clustering accessible to biomedical researchers worldwide.
